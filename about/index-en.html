<h1><center>Meet BetterSearch, the smart search engine</center></h1>
<center><p>Have you ever needed to find something on the Internet, but didn't found on your favorite search engine? BetterSearch is the solution!</p></center>
<h2>But, how it works?</h2>
<p>BetterSearch use keywords specified to detect the best search engine. We also may use artificial intelligence to provide you more relevant results...</p>
<p>BetterSearch only redirects you to another search engine, by using type of results usually found on these. There isn't any partnership with those search engine, which are: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Qwant (only available in French), Amazon, Wikipedia, Minteck Projects</p>
<h2>And privacy?</h2>
<p>At Minteck Projects™, your security is always our priority... We respect your privacy while providing you with best-quality services. We also try to collect less personnal informations...</p>
<p>However, by using BetterSearch, <b>you agree that we collect anonymous statistics info</b> that can improve your BetterSearch experience, experience of other users, and the software precision.</p>
<h2>Why so many languages? and countries?</h2>
<p>If BetterSearch is available in more than 15 countries and more than 7 languages, that's because we want the software to be open for all, and used in the whole world, and freely.</p>
<p>You can notice that there are two icons on the language selection page. The first one (a translate icon) means translation to this language was done by an automated translation software. The other one (a people logo) means translation to this language was done by a real person without using an automated translation softwares.</p>
<h2>And if that doesn't works fine?</h2>
<p>No software is 100% reliable. BetterSearch try to be most reliable possible, but software improvement will come by time and by usage by people. Simply by using it, you contribute to service improvment.</p>
<p>If results you find on search engine BetterSearch redirects you to are irrelevant, off-topic, or inappropriate, you can report that to concerned search engine moderators and report that to us (if we can solve the problem) to <b>minteck.projects+bs-reports@gmail.com</b></p>
<h2>Does that works on phone?</h2>
<p>Of course, BetterSearch works perfectly on small screens. Whatever device is it, it will work with any recent Web browser.</p>
<p>BetterSearch works with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, but may not work with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Minteck Projects™ also stop support for Internet Explorer in early 2020.</p>
