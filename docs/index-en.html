<h1><center>BetterSearch:cloud, official BetterSearch API</center></h1>
<code api-background vcenter>bettersearch://</code>
<p>BetterSearch, and its API (BetterSearch:cloud) helps you getting the most of all the features and technologies BetterSearch offers you. And the best, it's free!</p>
<p>You can feel free to recreate the <i><a title="Client-side of a client-server software" def>frontend</a></i> of the search engine to follow your ideas, to for example integrate with your own services. Don't forget to advertise us, this may help us!</p>
<p>Here's the URLs you need to call to access different features of BetterSearch:cloud. The API don't return JSON, or any exploitable language. It returns a message starting with <code>ok=</code> if everything done successfully (with result URL after <code>=</code>), or anything else if something went wrong.</p>
